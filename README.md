This project was created for a Software Engineering module as part of the Virtual and Augmented Reality Masters Program. It was a group project with 8 team members, that focused on the software development process and using core programming proinciples within the agile development framework, to develop a software program in a well organised manner.

We set ourselves the objective of creating a VR Art Gallery application, with various features such as multiplayer, AI art generation and painting on canvases.

We used Gitlab for version control as it was less restrictive with large file sizes. The link to the repository can be found [here](https://gitlab.scss.tcd.ie/software-engineering-group-10/vr-art-gallery). This repository just has the final application available for download in the release secton.

The project spanned about 3 months and was developed in Unity. All the functionality was created by our team and the map and some of the 3D assets were also created by our team.
